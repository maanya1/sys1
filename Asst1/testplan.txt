4. File with 1 word repeating multiple times and every other word
5. Recursive directories with 1 - 4
6. Overwriting files
7. Inputting too many flags
8. Not inputting enough flags
9. Inputting flags in the wrong order
10. Inputting flags that do not exist (anything other than `-b`, `-c`, `-d`, or `-R`)
11. Mixing flags, (ex. must be `-R -b`, not `-Rb`)
12. Giving an invalid pathname or filename
